# EDA-of-Unicorn-Companies

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset containing data of 1,000+ Unicorn Companies from different countries. The EDA done over here will contain 4 main steps :

**Discovering** : In this step I have just checked what is there in my dataset. What type of columns, what kind of datatypes do these columns have. Basically, it is a descriptive analysis of the dataset. <br>
**Cleaning** : In this step I have checked for duplicates and missing values.
**Transforming** : Some columns need to be transformed into different datatypes in order for me to conduct some analysis. So I will go about and check which columns need to be tranformed in order for me to perform some specific operations so that I can finally do some analysis.
**Visualization** : Finally, I will do some analysis using a visualization tool. I will use Matplotlib to analyze our dataset. This will give us some basic insight about our data.
